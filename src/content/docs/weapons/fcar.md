## History

### Patch 2.6.0

- Decreased damage from 25 to 22.
- Increased magazine size from 20 to 25.
- Increased the fall-off damage multiplier at max range from 50% to 55%, meaning the weapon does slightly more damage at range.
- Dev Note: Our data shows us that the FCAR is very strong in the hands of good players but harder to use for newer players. These changes hopefully rein in the weaponâ€™s power at higher skill levels, while making it slightly more forgiving to use for newer players

### Patch 2.2.0

- Decreased damage falloff modifier at max range from 67% to 50%
- Adjusted recoil pattern to make the weapon slightly less easy to control

### Patch 1.5.5

- Damage reduced: 26 to 25.
