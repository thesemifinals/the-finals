## General

import WeaponTable from "./weapon_table.astro";

<WeaponTable />

## Strategy

The FAMAS is highly accurate and can be effective at ranges farther than the [AKM](/weapons/akm) or [FCAR](/weapons/fcar).
It is at its peak when hitting headshots, where it can dual weapons like the [AKM](/weapons/akm) at short ranges.

## History

### Patch 2.2.0

- Adjusted recoil pattern to make the weapon slightly easier to control.
