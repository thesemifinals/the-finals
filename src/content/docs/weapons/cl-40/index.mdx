The CL-40 is a grenade launcher capable of high damage to grouped enemies,
as well as environment destruction given enough time.

## General

import WeaponTable from "./weapon_table.astro";

<WeaponTable />

## Strategy

The CL-40 excels in situations where enemies are going to be grouped together.
The most notable example of this is Powershift, where it can very quickly kill
all of the enemies on the platform.

The notable disadvantages of the CL-40 are:

1. Weak range due to bullet drop and travel time
2. Self-damage at close range

This makes the CL-40 have a very particular "sweet spot" for range where the travel
time isn't too long but it's not so close that you're killing yoursellf.
